# Fault-detection-in-Multisensory-System
A multiple fault classification method is discussed based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). After extracting features from the given signals and combining different fault types, PCA model is used for dimensionality reduction with KNN classifier to identify faults in abnormal data.
